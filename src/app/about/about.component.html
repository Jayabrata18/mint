                Welcome to Shroomiez fellow friend. Shroomiez is an NFT collection, community and platform which:
                <ul>
                    <li>Enables holders to decide on what is featured in the Shroomieverse</li>
                    <li>Features access to the most trusted dApps and NFT collections</li>
                    <li>Incentivizes the creation and reproduction of high quality content</li>
                </ul>
                Shroomiez will be treasury-backed thanks to Beramarket. Liquid-backing means higher trading liquidity,
                and high liquidity means a more stable market for the NFT collection.
